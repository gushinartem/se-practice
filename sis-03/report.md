# SIS #03 — Report: Smart Campus Room Availability Checker

## 1. Setup and reuse

<!-- Model: the exact model with its version, as the tool shows it ("ChatGPT" is a tool, not a
     model). If the tool does not show it, write: not displayed
     Reuse: week-05 if code/original/booking_v1.py is your Week 05 v1, copied unedited;
     week-06 if web/original/ is your Week 06 v1 export; fresh if you generated it for this SIS. -->

## 2. Baseline — before any new AI exchange

<!-- Written by you, without AI, before the first exchange of this SIS. Commit and push it
     first (README §2). Reusing Week 05/06 work does not exempt you: this section is new. -->

### 2.1 Scope in my own words

**Scope:** One responsive page and one Python function that check whether a requested time interval is available for a single selected room, using fictional booking data. They only report Available or Unavailable and never create, confirm or change bookings. There is no login, database, backend, external API or payment.

### 2.2 The acceptance criteria in my own words

| AC | In my own words |
| --- | --- |
| AC1 | Times are whole minutes after midnight. The start must be at least 0, the end must be after the start and no later than 1440, and the start must be strictly later than the current time (starting exactly now is not allowed). |
| AC2 | A booking may last at most 120 minutes. Exactly 120 minutes is fine; 121 is too long. |
| AC3 | If the selected room is blocked, every request is refused, whatever the times are. |
| AC4 | A request is refused if it overlaps any existing booking. If one interval ends exactly when the other starts, they only touch and that is allowed. |
| AC5 | The page shows a clear Available or Unavailable result, never something ambiguous. Checking must not change the existing bookings. |
| AC6 | When the input is invalid the user sees an understandable message, and the page stays usable on a narrow phone screen. |
### 2.3 Likely failure points

<!-- At least two. The brief's examples: endpoint overlap, starts-now. -->

| # | Failure point | AC | How I will check it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Endpoint overlap: using `<=` instead of `<` in the overlap test makes touching intervals look like overlaps, so a valid request is rejected. | AC4 | Run T1 (660-720 against 600-660, must be Available) and T10, and compare with T2 (a real overlap, must be Unavailable). |
| 2 | Starts-now: accepting `start == now` by using `>=` instead of `>`. | AC1 | Run T6 (540-570 with now = 540, must be Unavailable) and also a start one minute after now. |
| 3 | Duration boundary: using `< 120` or `<= 121`, so exactly 120 is rejected or 121 is accepted. | AC2 | Run T4 (720-840, must be Available) and T5 (720-841, must be Unavailable). |
| 4 | Day bounds: allowing an end after 1440, or rejecting an end of exactly 1440. | AC1 | Run T8 (1380-1440, must be Available) and T9 (1380-1441, must be Unavailable). |
| 5 | Mutation: sorting, merging or removing items in `existing` while checking, so a second check gives a different answer. | AC5 | Run T11 (same check twice, both must be Available) and compare `existing` before and after the call. |

### 2.4 The contract

| Parameter | Meaning | Type and allowed values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start` | Requested start time, in minutes after midnight (included in the interval). | `int`, `0 <= start < end` |
| `end` | Requested end time, in minutes after midnight (excluded from the interval). | `int`, `start < end <= 1440` |
| `now` | The current time, in minutes after midnight. | `int`, 0 to 1439 (assumed valid) |
| `blocked` | Whether the selected room is blocked. | `bool`, `True` or `False` |
| `existing` | The room's existing bookings, as `(start, end)` pairs. It must never be modified. | collection of `(int, int)` tuples |
| returns | `True` only when AC1 to AC4 all hold; `False` otherwise. | `bool` |

### 2.5 Initial assumptions and manual checks

**Assumptions:**

1. `now` is always valid (0 to 1439), so the function does not need to validate it.
2. An invalid request (reversed times, outside the day, too long) returns `False` instead of raising an error, because the contract says return `False` otherwise.
3. Every interval includes its start and excludes its end, so two intervals overlap only if `start < existing_end` and `existing_start < end`.
4. Duration is `end - start`, and the existing bookings are well-formed pairs with their start before their end.
**Checked manually:**
 
- T1 (660-720 against 600-660): 660 < 660 is false, so there is no overlap and the answer is Available.
- T2 (630-690 against 600-660): 630 < 660 and 600 < 690, so they overlap and the answer is Unavailable.
- T4 and T5: the durations are 120 and 121, so the first is allowed and the second is not.
- T6 (540-570 with now = 540): the start is not strictly after now, so the answer is Unavailable.
- T10 (720-780 against 600-660 and 700-760): it overlaps the second booking because 720 < 760 and 700 < 780, so the answer is Unavailable.


## 3. Python v1 review

     Path B). Quote the condition exactly. AC1-AC4 must all appear in the AC column. -->

## 5. Test cases — executed on both artifacts

<!-- Base for every case unless the row says otherwise: now = 540, blocked = False,
     existing = [(600, 660)]. Do not change the first four columns.
     Python columns: True, False or Error (it raised) — what the call actually returned.
       T11: the result of the SECOND call. T12: n/a.
       Path A: the checker runs both of your files on T1-T11 and compares (C2, C3).
     Page columns: Available, Unavailable or Not testable — what the page actually showed.
     Never write a result you did not observe. -->

| Case | Name | Input | Expected | Python v1 | Python final | Page v1 | Page final |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Touching | 660–720 | Available | | | | |
| T2 | Overlap | 630–690 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T3 | Blocked | 660–720, blocked | Unavailable | | | | |
| T4 | Exactly 120 min | 720–840 | Available | | | | |
| T5 | 121 min | 720–841 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T6 | Starts now | 540–570 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T7 | Reversed | 720–660 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T8 | Ends at midnight | 1380–1440 | Available | | | | |
| T9 | Past midnight | 1380–1441 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T10 | Second booking | 720–780, existing (600–660), (700–760) | Unavailable | | | | |
| T11 | Same check twice | 660–720, twice | Available | | | | |
| T12 | Narrow screen | T1 at ~375 px wide | Available | n/a | n/a | | |

## 10. Reflection

<!-- 100-200 words, in your own words, no AI. Compare AI-assisted coding (the Python part) with
     vibe coding (the Bolt part); one example each of a reliability, an availability/usability and
     a security risk; why review, tool permissions and tests stay human responsibilities; one AI
     recommendation you rejected or modified, and why; what you would improve next without
     expanding the scope. -->
